# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

Trying to tackle the 8 case studies from **[8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**!

## Case Study #1: Danny's Diner

This case study helps answer a few simple questions about the diner's customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with customers will help deliver a better and more personalised experience for diner's loyal customers.
These insights will help decide whether they should expand the existing customer loyalty program.


## Case Study #2: Pizza Runner

Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers. 

This case study requires further assistance to clean data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.


## Case Study #3: Foodie-Fi

Danny wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

He launches his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.


## Case Study #4: Data Bank

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!


## Case Study #5: Data Mart

Data Mart is Danny’s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyse his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it’s separate business areas.

The key business question he wants you to help him answer are the following:

What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?


## Case Study #6: Clique Bait

## Case Study #8: Fresh Segments

Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.
